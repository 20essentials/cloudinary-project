If you feel like diving into my code, here are some highlights youâ€™ll find interesting:

- **Animations triggered by the `wheel` event** _(mouse scroll)_ 
- **Animations using the `touchmove` event** _(user touch gestures)_
- **Animations tied to the `keydown` event** _(keyboard interactions)_
- **A `sprite` animation that creates a 3D illusion**
- **Infinite scrolling backgrounds/`patterns`**
- **Interactive image maps** using `<map>` and `<area>` for clickable regions
- **Creative use of CSS transformations** and `perspective` effects
